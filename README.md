Reinforced Iron Hedgehog Spikes: Deal 350 hit points of destruction, combining durability and damage for a balanced defense.
Reinforced Steel Hedgehog Spikes: The ultimate defensive spike, delivering 400 hit points of destruction while being immune to Demolisher explosions, ensuring your base remains secure even during the most chaotic sieges.
